> **Creator’s Courage**
> 
> the ability to come up with ideas (starting) and have the courage to try them out (asking).

> starting small, starting fast, and not worrying about what I didn’t know.

> focus above all else on being a starter, an experimenter, a learner.

> Now, Not How

> Many struggle to make their first dollar because they are so focused on how to make their first million.

> The thing is, most people don’t ask for what they want. They wish for it, they make “suggestions” and drop hints, they hope. But the simple fact of business is that only by asking do you receive what you want. No ASK? No GET. That applies to every part of life. Seriously, every part.

> PRO TIP: Follow Up! Follow Up! Follow Up! Studies show that if you initially get a no, your follow-up ask is TWICE as likely to get a yes.

> PRO TIP: Selling is helping. If you believe your product or service improves the lives of your customers, sales is just education
